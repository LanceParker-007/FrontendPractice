// Implement debouncing

// Implement throttling

// Debouncing vs Throttling
// A) Search fields in ecommerce websites: Debouncing makes more sense
//
// B) Resizing of window:
//    1) Track user behaviuour like how does he resize the window: Debouncing makes more sense
//    2) How frequently does he resize the window: Throttling makes more sense
//
// C) Button click:
//    1) Lets take example of shootung game: Throttling would make more sense
//       because different guns would have different rates and throttling would
//       help us achieve this thing better
// D) Scroll event: I guess same as resizing window
//
// Rate limiting ensures fairness and equal access
// by setting a limit on the number of requests a
// client can make to an API within a specified time
// window. Throttling maintains stability and performance
// by adjusting the allowed request rates based on current conditions.
