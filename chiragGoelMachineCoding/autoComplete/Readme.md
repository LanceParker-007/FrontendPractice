Statement: "Autocomplete Low-Level Design"

Tech Stack: Vanilla Js, HTML & CSS

Must have:

# On typing inside the search box, it should suggest options

# Users should be able to select one of the options

Good to have:

# Search should be performant enough

# It should avoid unnecessary network call

# It should be re-usable and customizable

# It should persist previously fetch data

<!-- Questions that can be asked -->

<!-- Before starting -->

# Is there any design?

# How we have to take and submit the input?

# Are there any APIs or local search?

\*\* Reply: Hardcode some data and make it a promise so that it mimic a behaviour of an API

# Do we have to show any default suggestion or only when someone types something?
